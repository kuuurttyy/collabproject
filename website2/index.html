                            </h4>
                                <p>A petty thief accepts the support of Recovery Road when they offer him refuge from his pursuer. When Venom Pipes steals a garden gnome from his neighbour’s garden, he is spotted in the act. Pursued down the streets by his determined neighbour wearing speedos, he hides out in a town hall where he encounters a Recovery Group for those with addictive tendencies. Little does he realise that, despite the seemingly bizarre addictions of his fellow addicts, Blot Misfire and Siv Hilda, his own addiction to stealing garden gnomes is an equally pressing issue he must overcome. With the aid of Counsellor Madeline Kym, who herself has alcoholic tendencies, the Road to Recovery begins.

                                <p>Madeline’s idea that Fitness is the key to overcoming addiction only escalates her dangerous attraction to Venom. Though the meeting starts on an unhealthy note when they discover Venom has stolen from Box 101, Madeline puts this aside. She plays a fitness CD and acts as the gym instructor as she makes the group perform a workout. Siv tries working out in her dress with great difficulty and is relieved to see the tortuous session end when Blot chokes on his Gobstopper during a star-jump. Madeline has a ‘word’ with Venom afterwards about his behaviour, yet what begins as a ‘telling-off’ blossoms into something more serious which they must hide from Blot and Siv at all costs.</p>

                                <p>As Madeline continues to boost the confidence of Recovery Road, she organises a rehearsal of Shakespeare’s famous romance with Venom as Romeo and Siv as Juliet. Madeline’s frustration with Venom kissing Siv, however, causes her to make Venom swap roles with Blot. When Blot leans in to give Siv a slobbery kiss he is met with a slap to the face as she demands to know why Venom can’t play Romeo. Madeline storms out in disgrace and embarrassment. However, when Blot who stayed behind after the last meeting reveals the truth of her and Venom’s affair, Recovery Road is put in jeopardy.</p>

                                <p>In an attempt to convince Madeline to return, Venom brings in his guitar and harmonica to the next meeting so they can write a song for her. Problem is, as Siv isn’t afraid to point out, Venom’s ability to play guitar is awful. Luckily for them, Blot turns out to be a bit of a prodigy.</p>

In fact, his Dad never told him what happened to his Mum, only forced him to do chores around the house.</p>
                    <p>At 10 he stole his Dad’s wallet and his Dad, furious, locked him in his room. He escaped through the window, however, and returned, the next day, with a neighbour’s garden gnome hidden under his hoodie to keep him company. Ever since then he’s been nicking Garden Gnomes as well as other small, mundane objects, which he steals as a form of ‘comfort theft.’ Recovery Road is his only chance of avoiding re-offending with the more serious crimes his father encourages him to commit. But will this one shot at redemption be enough?</p>

                        <img class="img-thumbnail pull-right" src="img/characters/siv.jpg" style="margin: 5px;">Growing up on a rough estate in Bournemouth, she spent most of her time inside afraid to venture into the exterior world. She had no friends at school and just buried her head in books to the extent that she became a massive fan of the great Gatsby. She became obsessed with the suave characters in Fitzgerald’s novel, even taking up dancing lessons as a form of imitation. She would put 20s music on and dance the waltz to it every night, until her drunk mother would come home and order her to “turn that old shit off.”</p>
                    <p>Persistent and remaining integral to her dream, however, she continued her dancing class but with one problem- she couldn’t take criticism and kept answering back at any faults in her movement or balance, to the point where her instructors simply couldn’t take her defensiveness and kicked her out of the group. Her dreams shattered, she joining Recovery Road, forced to put her dancing trophy (which is actually fake) into box 101, on arrival. In an attempt to earn a real dancing trophy she’s started entering competitions, but defends her ego until the judges simply can’t stand it anymore. Will she stop living in the past and accept that she, like everyone else at Recovery Road has issues they have to accept and face up to?</p>

He was bullied in school for being laconic (he didn’t speak until the age of 8, but actually just had a fear of speaking) and as a consequence suffered depression which has lasted up till now. His Mum, as a result, told him to stop worrying and just gave him more food.</p>
                    <p>As part of a prank a group of bullies pinned him down to the ground, stole his wallet and phone and shoved gobstoppers in his mouth. The taste as the gobstopper hit his mouth was a turning point in his life. He couldn’t stop eating them. His teeth have had to be replaced after turning black although now his new ones have blackened. He uses gobstoppers and other sweets like lollipops as a defence mechanism and attachment to childhood, so he didn’t exactly fare well in the many job interviews he’s tried and failed to succeed in. Concerned about his lack of maturity, his Mum signed him up for Recovery Road, a move Blot never quite understands. In addition, losing his treasured Blanket to Box 101, where each character must throw away a weekly item attached to their condition, is something he’ll never quite overcome.</p>

                        <img class="img-thumbnail pull-right" src="img/characters/madeline.jpg" style="margin: 5px;">Attending a Kentish Private School, she became interested in psychology during 6th form when she had mind-related anxieties of her own-worrying about her appearance in front of others or whether or not she’d make a fool of herself. She was so self-conscious she couldn’t leave her bedroom without applying makeup.</p>

                    <p>So, in an anxious attempt to fit in, she joined the drugs crowd and got heavily involved with smoking and alcohol. This didn’t bode well for her future, but, after taking a gap year she was ready to study a Psychology course at Bournemouth University. Realising, on graduation how tough the industry is, she’s decided to set up a recovery group in this quaint seaside town, but sees it more as a stepping stone than an actual interest. Despite trying to cover up her continuing reliance on drugs for happiness , she may well need the support of the people in her own recovery group herself, as well as open up and become more passionately involved in her work. But when Venom joins the list of attendants, this passion may get out of hand…</p>
